This repository contains annotation and adjudication guidelines for pain mentions in mental health records, code for calculation of inter-annotator agreements (to be added), code for building various sentence classifiers (to be added), and results from pain studies.

**File: Annotation Guidelines**

Includes instructions that were followed for the annotation of pain and pain-related terms. 
It also includes adjudication guidelines.

**File: SQL_query_for_dco_extraction**

This is the SQL query that was used to extract documents for the annotation exercise.

**Folder: LDN READ Codes**

This folder contains the READ codes for pain diagnosis, treatment and medication that were used to identify patients with pain within the GP records of Lambeth DataNet.

**Folder: classifier**

This folder contains the scripts to train the BERT and non-BERT models

**Folder: cohort**

This folder contains scripts to explore the descriptives of the cohort in question, and generate venn diagrams to examine various overlaps. Also includes STATA code for logistic regression analysis.

**Knowledge Graph Embedding**

The KGE model scripts are located at: https://github.com/jayachaturvedi/pain_kge_model
